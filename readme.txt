Allows theme developers to add order/sort functionality for categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

== Description ==
Plugin can be used for reordering categories, tags and custom taxonomies. This plugin is primarily intended as an aid to theme developers.

Plugin supports multisite installation.

= Requirements =
The minimum requirement is that you have at least WordPress 3.5 installed.

= Example usage =
**Fetching sorted terms from custom taxonomy will be enabled by default:**

`$terms = get_terms( 'your-taxonomy-name' );`

**If you wish to sort by name (disable plugin's custom sorting) you will have to set 'i_order_terms' to 'false':**

`$terms = get_terms( 'your-taxonomy-name', 'i_order_terms=0' );`

= Warning =
Plugin ads new column to 'term_taxonomy' table, make sure to backup your database before installing. Column is removed when you delete plugin.


== Installation ==
1. You can download and install "I Order Terms" plugin by using the built in WordPress plugin installer. Or you can upload plugin folder "i-order-terms" manually to your "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. You will need to enable plugin for taxonomy that you wish to sort.

= Enabling plugin for taxonomy =
You can use settings page or add code in your function file. There are two options you can use to make taxonomy sortable:

1) You can enable sorting when registering taxonomy:
`
register_taxonomy( 'your-taxonomy-name', 'your-post-type', array(
	'label' => __('Category'),

	// this parameter is used to enable
	// sorting for taxonomy 'your-taxonomy-name'
	'i_order_terms' => true,
));
`

2) Other option is to pass array of taxonomies (or tags/categories) via filter "i_order_terms_taxonomies" in your functions file like this:
`
function custom_i_order_terms_taxonomies($taxonomies) {
	$taxonomies = array_merge($taxonomies, array('taxonomy', 'category'));
	return $taxonomies;
}
add_filter('i_order_terms_taxonomies', 'custom_i_order_terms_taxonomies');
`

This will enable taxonomy sorting for 'taxonomy' and 'category' taxonomies.
Naturally you will have to provide your taxonomy names.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work on WordPress multisite? =
Yes, it will work on multisite installation.

= What permissions are required for users to reorder terms? =
User needs to have "manage_categories" permission to be able to order terms.
